    "* Favor clarity over assumption: If a section appears present but vague or off-topic, mark it as present but inconsistent with its intended purpose.\n",
    "* Be conservative in evaluation: If a section lacks substance, even if labeled, mark its content quality as \"No\".\n",
    "* Explain briefly but precisely: Justifications should directly reference what is (or isn't) in the text and why that supports your judgment.\n",
    "* Consistency matters: A section with off-topic content should be flagged under “purpose_consistency” even if it is formally present and sufficiently long.\n",
    "* Treat examples cautiously: If an ADR includes a sample or placeholder (e.g., “This is how you should fill out the context section”), treat it as misuse unless clearly replaced with project-specific information.\n",
    "* Strict Scope Rule: If a section includes substantial content that belongs to another section (e.g., \"Context\" contains detailed comparisons between alternatives, which belongs in \"Considered Options\"), you must mark purpose_consistency = No. Even if the content is well-written or informative, it fails to fulfill the section's specific role and should be penalized. Do not give it a perfect score or mark it as consistent.\n",
    "* Even if useful information appears under the wrong heading, it must not be marked as \"purpose_consistent\". Penalize any section that fulfills another section's role. Do not assume intent based on quality—judge only structure and alignment.\n",
